== Architecture

The focus of the hackathon was on development of the OGC API - Common, the OGC API - Features, OGC API – Processes, the OGC API – Coverages and the OGC API – Map Tiles standards. Implementations of these specifications were deployed in the Hackathon infrastructure in order to build a solution with the architecture shown in <<img_architecture>>. As shown on the illustration, the architecture adopted a multi-tier approach that included one or more implementations of each OGC API specification deployed on the wider Internet (e.g. in participants' own Cloud environments), as well as some implementations deployed in the Ordnance Survey's Cloud which is hosted on Microsoft Azure.

The OGC API - Common specification documents the set of common practices and shared requirements that have emerged from the development of Resource Oriented Architectures and Web APIs within the OGC. The specification serves as a common foundation upon which all OGC APIs will be built. The OGC API - Processes specification defines how a client application can request the execution of a process, how the inputs to that process can be provided, and how the output from the process is handled. The OGC API - Map Tiles specification defines an OGC standard for a Web Map Tile API that can serve map tiles of spatially referenced data using tile images with predefined content, extent, and resolution. The OGC API - Coverages specification defines a Web API for accessing coverages that are modelled according to the http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/09-146r6/09-146r6.html[Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS) 1.1]. The hackathon also sought to maintain consistency between the aforementioned specifications and the OGC API - Features specification. The OGC API - Features specification offers the capability to create, modify and query geospatial feature data on the Web.


=== Service Implementations

==== pygeoapi

pygeoapi is a Python server implementation of the emerging OGC API specifications. Early versions of this software implemented the OGC API - Features specification (formerly WFS 3.0). Recent versions of the software have included support for both the OGC API - Features and the OGC API - Processes specifications. Support for these specifications makes it possible publish feature data and geospatial processes. As the name suggests the software is built using the Python programming language and is supported by a developer toolchain that includes Docker and Git/Github.

==== 52°North JavaPS

The 52°North JavaPS product is an open source implementation of both the Web Processing Service (WPS) standard and the OGC API - Processes specification. JavaPS enables the deployment of geospatial processes on the Web in a way that conforms to OGC standards. The software is built using the Java programming language and is supported by a developer toolchain that includes Maven and Git/Github. The software features a pluggable architecture for processes and data encodings that is based on the 52°North https://wiki.52north.org/SensorWeb/Iceland[Iceland] project which represents a generic Java framework for OGC Web Services. By virtue of being based on the Iceland project, JavaPS provides components that are associated with processing geospatial data, for example request objects, response objects, decoders, encoders, parsers.

==== Esri
Esri produce both an installable product (ArcGIS Enterprise) and SaaS product (ArcGIS Online) which support adopted OGC specifications. ArcGIS Enterprise as a server implements WMS, WMTS, WCS2, WPS, WFS2, KML, Geopackage etc as well as other de-facto standards. ArcGIS Online as a server implements WMTS, WFS2 as well as other de-facto standards.
Until the OGC API standards are stable and formally adopted, it is not feasible to implement them in the released products. Therefore for the purposes of the Hackathon and further R&D, Esri have implemented the OGC-API tiles as a facade on to ArcGIS Online tiled services. Technically this is currently implemented as a node.js server running in Microsoft Azure.

==== rasdaman
rasdaman ("raster data manager") is a flexible, scalable datacube engine with location-transparent federation capabilities. Open-source rasdaman is available from www.rasdaman.org. Being WCS reference implementation rasdaman supports OGC WMS, WCS, and WCPS (the OGC datacube analytics standard). For experimentation with the emerging OGC OpenAPI interface for coverages a rasdaman server has been made available on Amazon with an OpenAPI facade to WCS; access has been demonstrated with EURAC and Sinergise OpenAPI clients.

==== ldproxy

ldproxy is an implementation of the OGC API family of standards, based on the W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices. It is written in Java
(link:https://github.com/interactive-instruments/ldproxy[Source Code]) and is typically deployed using docker (link:https://hub.docker.com/r/iide/ldproxy/[DockerHub]).

The software originally started in 2015 as a Web API for feature data based
on WFS 2.0 capabilities. In addition to the JSON/XML encodings, an emphasis
is placed on an intuitive HTML representation.

The current version supports WFS 2.0 instances as well as PostgreSQL/PostGIS databases as backends. It implements all conformance classes and recommendations of "OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core" plus a number of experimental OGC API Features extensions (CRS support, /items path, property selection, geometry simplification, transactions, dynamic links, and more). ldproxy also has draft implementations for additional resource types (Tiles, Styles).

==== Helyx SIS

The Helyx team implemented a WPS 3.0 style API with the primary work completed in the OGC Routing API Pilot, which is currently on-going. The focus of the component implementation was to produce a schemaless collections endpoint to act as a storage location for data production processes. This could be typical OGC processes in a WPS sent, or with could be in the style of a WFS endpoint.

An advantage of the schemaless (and in the future, potentially serverless) approach is the efficiency of the hashing procedure enabling many KVPs to be entered even on a low spec machine. Additionally, this approach has the potential to be made production ready quickly due to the simplicity of the implementation requirements. A future possibility for this piece of work is to implement it using Hazelcast, as it backs up KVPs to a NoSQL database therefore caching the requests and increasing performance accordingly.

==== ZOO-Project

The ZOO-Project product available at www.zoo-project.org is an open-source implementation of both the Web Processing Service (WPS) standard (version 1.0.0 and 2.0) and the OGC API - Processes specification. The ZOO-Kernel is the main component written in C which enables the deployment of geospatial processes, named ZOO-Services that can be implemented in various programming languages (C/C++, Fortran, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, Perl, R, PHP, Ruby), on the Web in a way that conforms to OGC standards. ZOO-Kernel also supports the deployment of existing Open-Source GIS applications such as OrfeoToolBox and SAGA-GIS. Optionally the execution of OrfeoToolBox applications can be done remotely on an HPC server using SLURM scheduler.

==== EOxServer

EOxServer (http://eoxserver.org) was started more than 10 years ago as a reference implementation of WCS in particular the Earth Observation Application Profile (EO-WCS).

Support for the OGC API - Coverages draft was implemented in EOxServer in the OpenAPI branch (https://github.com/EOxServer/eoxserver/tree/openapi).

A demonstration using the provided Sentinel-2 data is available online at https://ows.eox.at/openapi/ and integrated in the Sinergise OGC Coverages Demo Client.

=== Client Implementations

==== OpenSphere OGC API Plugin

https://github.com/ngageoint/opensphere[OpenSphere] is a pluggable, single-page, GIS web application that supports both 2D and 3D views. It supports hooking up to many common servers and formats such as ArcGIS, Geoserver (and other OGC WMS/WFS services), XYZ, TMS, KML, GeoJSON, Shapefiles and CSVs. Other features include animation of both raster and vector data, import and export of various formats, and saving files and layers between sessions. Sigma Bravo extended OpenSphere to support OGC API - Features and OGC API - Map Tiles.

==== Hexagon LuciadLightspeed

LuciadLightspeed provides a foundation for advanced geospatial analytics applications. It allows users to create high performance command & control and location intelligence applications with clean design implementation and rapid application development. A desktop client application was implemented using LuciadLightspeed and configured to interface services implementing the OGC API - Map Tiles specification.

==== Solenix WPS Demo Client

The Solenix WPS Demo client is an adaptation of the OGC Testbed 14 client, accounting for some of the changes introduced with the OGC API - Processing.
The client application runs from a web browser and connects to servers providing the OGC API - Processing.

A total of 7 servers were connected during the Hackathon, providing the participants with the scenario of a client running in the web browser served via HTTPS and the resulting security rules.
The client was used during the Hackathon to debug server implementations, and in particular the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) behavior in web browsers.

==== Esri OGC API-Tiles Demo Client
The Esri client application is a simple Leaflet application which connects to the Esri OGC API-Tiles server implementation for testing purposes.


==== Sinergise OGC Coverages Demo Client

The Sinergise OGC Coverages Demo Client is a single-page Javascript application, using Leaflet.js to show the data from different backends. Support for two different backends was implemented, Rasdaman and EOxServer from EOX IT Services GmbH. The frontend is available at http://webdev.sentinel-hub.com/ogc-hackathon/index.html (view source for additional info).

==== Helyx SIS Demonstration Clients

Helyx produced two clients as part of the hackathon, one standalone web client and one QGIS client. The Standalone Web Client was implemented with the purpose of providing a _walkthough_ of the OGC API to discover processes. The web client, which was implemented using JavaScript, was able to identify the inputs and outputs of each process, request inputs from the user, execute a process and display the result. The QGIS client performed a similar function to the web client, except it was designed and built in the QGIS plugin environment. The QGIS client walks through the API and identifies processes and parameters to automatically populate the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for each process therefore providing the user with well-defined inputs. 

==== ZOO-Project Demonstration Clients

The ZOO-Project provided a Swagger demonstration interface which can be found at https://demo.mapmint.com/swagger-ui/dist. A demonstration user interface based on interfaces available at www.zoo-project.org was also provided. It is available here: https://demo.mapmint.com/examples3/spatialtools.html. It can be used to invoke execution of 4 services using the OGC API - Processes. The ZOO-Project also provided an https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org[Orfeo ToolBox] application named BandMath. Orfeo ToolBox is an open-source project for state-of-the-art remote sensing, including a fast image viewer, apps callable from Bash, Python or QGIS, and a powerful C++ API.

=== Validation Implementations

==== TEAM Engine

TEAM Engine (Test, Evaluation, And Measurement Engine) is a Java-based application for testing web services and other information resources. It executes test suites developed using the popular TestNG framework, OGC Compliance Test Language (CTL) scripts, and possibly other JVM-friendly languages. It is lightweight and easy to run from the command-line or as a web application.
TEAM Engine can be used to test almost any type of service or information resource. It is the official test harness used by the Open Geospatial Consortium's (OGC) http://cite.opengeospatial.org/[compliance program]. Visit the http://opengeospatial.github.io/teamengine/[project documentation website] for more information.

Currently, there is a test suite available to verify "OGC API - Features" service implementations. The test suite is written in Java using the TestNG framework and https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-wfs30[source code is publicly available]. Also, there is a public installation of the test suite on http://cite.opengeospatial.org/te2/[OGC CITE Beta environment].
